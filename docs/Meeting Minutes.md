# Sample Meeting Minutes

This sample shows how the minutes follow the expectations. See how the items are clear for the reader, and see how the focus is on action to move the project forward.

Even though your team has different roles and responsibilities, all team members are involved and do something to improve the overall project.

The minutes are quite long, and this length shows the team has discussed lots of issues and worked hard to make the project thorough.

>
> **b. GitHub Documentation Improvements**
