# Setting team member responsibilities

To make sure your meeting works well, all people at the meeting should check the protocols to understand expected behaviour.

Some key ideas for good meetings include the following:

- Arrive on time.
- Keep an open mind.
- Actively listen and respect the opinions of others. One good way to do this is to have a "no crosstalk" rule, where each person is given, say, 2 mins to speak.
- Participate.
- Avoid dominating.
- Avoid conflict situations.
- Ask questions to help with your understanding.
- Note down any actions that you have to do from the meeting.
- Work on your agreed actions.
