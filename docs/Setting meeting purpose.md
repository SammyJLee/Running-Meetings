## What to do in a meeting?

Meetings are an excellent way to check in with all members about the following:

- How is the project developing? Progress updates are essential.
- Are people on track? Make sure the task schedule is being followed.
- Does the team agree with the work being done? Make sure you have consensus through discussion.
- Is the workload distribution fair? Make sure everyone is happy with task allocation.
- Are there any issues that needs addressing/resolving? Clear up issues in meetings.
- Are all members contributing to the best of their abilities?
- Do any members need extra help/clarification? Should the team help or should the member consult the instructor?
- What is the next stage of work that we'll discuss in the next meeting?

You'll receive templates of what to include, but the basics of meetings are action: *what have we done, what will we do, who will do it, by when*?


Do not leave any issues unresolved; work on them (with instructor help as needed) right away!

For meetings to work well, you should have a pre-set agenda.
