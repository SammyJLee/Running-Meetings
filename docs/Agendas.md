# Setting Agendas

The agenda is a short list of topics that you will work on in the meeting.

The main goal of the agenda is to decide what you want to get done at the meeting, and it is decided _before_ the meeting takes place.

In the meeting itself, you can add any new information that comes up that is not on the list, but one goal of the agenda is to make sure all the important information you need to discuss is included beforehand.

## What goes in the agenda?

Agendas can include:

- **Information**: For example, this could be updates on work.
- **Action items**: what actions do you want to review and what actions do you want to set? For example, Sunny will conduct user tests on March 12
- **Discussion**: what things do you want the team to discuss? For example, do we all like the graphics? Do we need to change the order of navigation links?

### Who is involved in the agenda?

One person each meeting should be responsible for the agenda, and everyone in the team should and can add to the agenda.

The person responsible for the agenda should get feedback from all teammates on what theyâ€™d like to include in the next meeting.
This feedback can be sent via email or other communication channel. It can look like this sample below:
