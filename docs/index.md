# Introduction

This section contains information, templates, and samples about team meetings, minutes, and agendas.

Each person should be responsible for parts of team meetings; one person will _create the agenda_ (after consulting everyone), one will _chair the meeting_, and one will _record the minutes and upload_ them. All other people need to contribute to the meeting to move projects forward.

Practicing meetings, setting agendas, and creating minutes gives you a chance to assess the value of meetings for any group project you work on. Meetings are common to all organizations so, as you take part in them, make sure to evaluate the effectiveness of all parts of the meetings. Doing this evaluation may help in future job interviews, for example, where you show a potential employer your approach/process to making group projects effective, efficient, and valuable.

## The value of meetings

As you are working on a project together, you need to communicate effectively, and team meetings are one place to do that.

Team meetings are vital for all project work. Here are a few valuable reasons for having meetings:

- They enable all of you to know what people are going to do, ensuring that things get done on your project.
- They allow you to come together, check in on work progress, and help each other out with problems.
- They can improve team performance and project quality.
- They can improve collaboration on projects, especially in this project where you are in different locations and on different courses.
- They allow you to gel as a team. The meeting is your opportunity to share information.

## Dangers of not having meetings

As meetings allow you all to keep updated, discuss ideas, and share progress, they can make sure all team members understand what is happening, who is doing what, and how you can all work together.

Without meetings, these things can happen:

- People work on things which haven't been approved by the team. Everyone must be on the same page;
- Time can be wasted; the meetings enable you to carry on where you left off;
- Important information can get lost. The meeting is the place for you to document all work, what needs to be done, by whom, and by when;
- Social loafers (aka Slackers) can coast through. Meetings allow you to keep the team on task, even when you all have different levels of work through the project.

The next part goes over _agendas_ and _meeting minutes_.
These are vital to productive meetings. Action is the goal of all meetings, moving the team and project forward continually.

> **Takeaway:** Meetings have little value if there is no action.
