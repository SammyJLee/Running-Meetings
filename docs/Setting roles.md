# The Meeting Recorder

The Recorder should take notes during a meeting (see below for template and instructions) and then turn those notes into meeting minutes.

The Recorder should complete the minutes up to one day after the meeting, and share them with team members and SamL.

Include the word “Minutes” , your team name, and the meeting date in the file name.

**Example**: Dream Team Minutes Feb 24, 2023

Meeting minutes instructions and template for recorder.

The recorder can take notes as they wish and then record the notes using the template below. Here are some tips.

## Use complete sentences

Anyone reading the minutes (whether they were at the meeting or not) should be able to quickly and easily understand what was done/decided from your minutes.

### Record actions/decisions, not conversations

Minutes shouldn’t contain who said what.

Instead, you want to simply say what the group did/decided (briefly!) and who will do what by when to follow up (if needed):

X Bad example: Susie said a,b,c, Fred said d, e, f, the group decided z.

√ Good example: The group discussed y and decided z. Susie will email a draft to all team members by Feb 28, 2023.

## Match agenda items/numbering exactly

The minutes for a meeting should always match its agenda exactly. In other words, the minutes contain the same numbered/lettered topics, but just with the news/decisions added.

## Format effectively for easy skimming

As always, use graphic highlighting techniques effectively.

Look at this template, which follows the agenda.
